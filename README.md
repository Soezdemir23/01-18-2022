Daily Grind: Trying to apply what I learned (PHP) something real. In one hour

## What I tried:
Take an order from html form and write it into a file.
I wanted it to use the second line as a next entry and it didn't reall work.
## What didn't work:
I tried to add a second entry after returning back



Either PHP is wonky, or the system configuration is wonky, or I am not there yet.
